# Smoke test results

Run by hand against a real token, never in CI. This file records **check names,
dates and pass/fail only** — return values (account tag, guild count, friend
count, settings) stay on the console and are not written down.

Times are UTC. One table, one row per check, grouped by suite, with a tally at the
top. Re-running a suite replaces every row it owns, so the table always shows the
latest state rather than growing a block per run — and a check that gets renamed
does not leave a ghost behind.

## What earlier runs found

`login.mjs` ran twice on 2026-08-03. The first failed and the second passed once
patched; that script does not log itself. Two bugs came out of it, each fixed with
an offline test:

- `READY.js` — `user_guild_settings` arrives as `{ version, partial, entries }`,
  not an array.
- `UserManager.js` — `GET /users/:id` is bot-only; a user token gets 403 code 40001.

The 2026-08-04 runs added the eight read-only checks of tier 1b and found:

- `user.fetchBurstCredit()` — `GET /users/@me/burst-credits` answered `404` on a
  live account. A direct probe outside the client got the same bare `404 code 0` on
  API v9 and v10, while `/users/@me/premium-usage` on the same token answered a
  typed `10084` and `/users/@me/billing/country-code` answered `200`. So the token
  was fine and the route is simply gone. The method, its route, its typing and its
  offline test were deleted, which is why it no longer appears below.
- `channel.searchApplicationCommands()` — failed `50013` at first because the check
  grabbed whatever channel came first in the cache. The route is fine; the check now
  prefers a DM and reads `50013` as "route reachable, channel blocks the
  permission". It then failed a second way: `permissionsFor()` returns `null` while
  the self member is uncached, which excluded every channel.
- The other six passed on the first try.

The tier 2 write runs on the same day found two more, both in the library rather
than in the checks:

- **Every request went out with a bot `User-Agent`.** `@discordjs/rest` appends its
  own `User-Agent: DiscordBot (…)` after the headers it is given, and that key
  differs in case from the lowercase `user-agent` the selfbot shim sets, so both
  were sent and Discord read the last one. Most routes did not care;
  `POST /users/@me/invites` answered `204` with an empty body instead of creating
  an invite. Proven by sending the same request twice by hand: browser UA gave
  `200` plus an invite, bot UA gave `204`. `rewriteUserAgent()` now collapses them.
- **`Invite` could not represent a friend invite.** They carry `channel: null`, and
  upstream `_patch` reads `data.channel.id` straight, so building one threw
  `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null`. Tier 1b missed it because the account
  had zero invites, so no `Invite` was ever constructed. The offline test used a
  hand-made `{ code }` payload with no `channel` key at all and missed it the same
  way; it now uses the real shape.

Tier 2.5 sent real messages for the first time, in a throwaway empty group DM, and
found one more:

- **A user token cannot fetch a single message.**
  `GET /channels/:id/messages/:messageId` answers `403 code 20002`, "Only bots can
  use this endpoint", while the list route with `around=<id>&limit=1` answers `200`
  with that exact message. Six of the eleven checks failed on it at once, because
  every one of them verified its work by reading the message back.
  `MessageManager#_fetchSingle` now goes through the list route and still throws a
  `10008` `DiscordAPIError` when the message is gone, so callers that catch that
  code keep working. The `message.delete()` check had been passing for the wrong
  reason — it treated any fetch error as proof of deletion, and 20002 is not that.

Tier 2.6 widened all three suites — group DM management on the sandbox, restricted
guilds, per-guild notification settings, `RichPresence.getExternal`, fetching
another user, and asserting that gateway packets really arrive. Two more findings:

- **Any `CHANNEL_UPDATE` for a group DM killed the client.** `GroupDMChannel`
  installed `recipients` as a read-only accessor directly on the instance, and
  `Base#_clone()` runs `Object.assign(Object.create(this), this)`, so the clone
  inherited that accessor and the copy threw
  `TypeError: Cannot set property recipients`. It surfaced the moment the suite
  renamed its sandbox, and it was not a failed check — the process died inside the
  packet handler. Renaming a group DM from any client, not just this one, would
  have done it. `recipients` is now a getter/setter pair on the prototype, with the
  setter there only to absorb the upstream constructor's assignment, and `toJSON`
  names it explicitly since `flatten` only walks own enumerable properties.
- **Account settings no longer arrive over the gateway.** Discord sends
  `USER_SETTINGS_PROTO_UPDATE`, a protobuf payload; the fork only handles the old
  JSON `USER_SETTINGS_UPDATE`, which never fires. Guild settings, notes and
  relationships all still push fine. The practical effect is that `client.settings`
  goes stale when something changes it elsewhere — `fetch()` and `edit()` are the
  only ways to refresh it. Decoding protobuf is out of scope, so this is recorded
  rather than fixed.

Tier 3 reached voice, the one area copied wholesale from v13 and never run. It now
works, but only after five separate faults, every one of them in the fork:

- **A user account could never join a guild voice channel.** `joinChannel` gates on
  `channel.joinable`, which asks `guild.members.me` for permissions — and a user
  token's `READY` never seeds the client's own member, so the member cache is empty,
  `members.me` is `null`, and `joinable` is `false` for every channel. Measured on a
  real guild: `joinable false`, `viewable false`, `permissionsFor(user) null`, and
  after one `guild.members.fetch(self)` the same channel reports `joinable true`.
  `joinChannel` now loads that member first.
- **The voice websocket retried failures that can never succeed.** `onClose`
  reconnected on any close code, five times, then emitted the give-up as `debug` —
  which no one listens to — so the caller sat until a 15s `VOICE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`
  and learned nothing about the cause. Fatal codes (4004, 4006, 4017) now raise the
  real reason immediately; 4014, being a normal "you were disconnected", just stops
  the retries without throwing at applications that never registered an error
  handler.
- **`4017 E2EE/DAVE protocol required` was real, and is now gone.** Discord has
  required end-to-end encryption on every non-stage voice call since March 2026.
  IDENTIFY never carried `max_dave_protocol_version`, so the voice server closed the
  socket the moment it read the payload — on gateway versions 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4, each
  probed with a freshly minted session. The fix wraps `@snazzah/davey`, the same
  native MLS binding `@discordjs/voice` uses, in `networking/DAVESession.js`: the
  websocket now speaks DAVE's binary frames, the connection drives the epoch and
  transition handshake, and audio is encrypted inside the existing transport
  encryption rather than instead of it. `@snazzah/davey` is an `optionalDependency`;
  without it `joinChannel` throws a sentence naming the package instead of letting
  the caller discover 4017 for themselves.
- **IDENTIFY was missing `channel_id`, and the manager listened to strangers.**
  Discord requires `channel_id` from gateway v9 and every real client sends it
  regardless. Worse, `ClientVoiceManager#onVoiceStateUpdate` acted on every
  `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE` in the channel, not only the client's own: someone else
  leaving ran `_disconnect()` on our connection, and someone else joining overwrote
  our `sessionId` with theirs. Both are fixed.
- **`4006 Session is no longer valid` was ours after all — a stripped port.**
  `setTokenAndEndpoint` ran `endpoint.match(/([^:]*)/)[0]`, throwing away everything
  after the colon. That made sense in the v13 era, when Discord appended a useless
  `:80`. Today it hands out `c-hkg12-….discord.media:8443`, and dropping the port
  connected the websocket to port 443 of a _different_ voice process — one that had
  never heard of our session, so it closed with 4006. The endpoint now keeps its
  port and only the legacy `:80` is stripped.

  Finding it took ruling out everything else first: `server_id`, `channel_id`,
  `user_id` and `token` all verified against a live gateway, and `session_id`
  matching the shard's own `sessionInfo.sessionId` byte for byte. `rtcRegion` was
  forced to `singapore` (`c-sin12`), `japan` (`c-nrt05`, `c-nrt07`, `c-nrt08`,
  `c-nrt10`, `c-nrt12`), `us-east` (`c-iad22`) and `rotterdam` (`c-ams01`), then set
  back to `auto`. The tell was hiding in the endpoint strings all along: every run
  that failed had been handed `:8443`, and the two that got further had been handed
  `:443`, where dropping the port happens to land on the right process anyway. It
  looked like luck of the draw between voice servers; it was which port Discord
  picked.

- **One cooperative server exposed a second real bug before the port fix landed.**
  It answered `No session available`, thrown by our own `DAVESession`: the underlying
  davey session was only created on `dave_prepare_epoch` (opcode 24), but the voice
  server sends the external sender (25) and proposals (27) _before_ announcing the
  epoch. `@discordjs/voice` calls `session.reinit()` the moment it builds the session
  and this port had dropped that line. `createDaveSession` now initialises eagerly.

Voice now passes all five checks against a real channel. The handshake runs end to
end — IDENTIFY, READY, SELECT_PROTOCOL, `SESSION_DESCRIPTION` carrying
`secure_frames_version: 1`, a 391-byte MLS key package out on opcode 26, the external
sender back on opcode 25 — and the client joins, plays, opens a receive stream, opens
a Go Live connection and leaves cleanly. Alone in a channel the DAVE group never
reaches an epoch, so `session.ready` stays `false` and audio travels under transport
encryption only; there is nobody else in the group to encrypt for. Video and Go Live
are still not end-to-end encrypted at all.

Group DM with a second account passes end to end, and turned up an API gap rather
than a bug:

- **`ring()` cannot start a call.** With no call in progress Discord answers `{}`
  and does nothing at all — no `CALL_CREATE`, no ringing. A call comes into being
  when you send a voice state update naming the channel, which is what the real
  client does when you press the call button; only then does `ring()` produce
  `CALL_UPDATE` with the recipient listed. The fork exposes no method for that
  first step, so the suite sends the gateway payload itself. Anyone using `ring()`
  on its own will find it silently doing nothing.

Ownership transfer is deliberately absent from the suite. `setOwner` cannot be
undone — you cannot take the group back — and the cleanup step would only make the
client leave, stranding the channel on the second account forever.

The call itself is only signalling here. Actually hearing anything would need the
voice gateway, which is blocked by DAVE.

`SKIP` in the table below means the check could not run, not that it passed. The
four profile writes are blocked by hCaptcha on `PATCH /users/@me`: the library
behaves correctly by surfacing the `400`, and testing them needs a `captchaSolver`
configured on the client.

## Not tested against a real account

Nothing below has ever run against Discord. The table further down does not
mention them at all — absence there means untested, not passing.
